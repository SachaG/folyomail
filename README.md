## What It Is

This is the email that [Folyo](http://folyo.me) clients will receive when a designer replies to one of their job postings. 

## Instructions

Since the final email will be sent out of a Rails app, this is a very simple [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com) site that simulates the template. To run it:

- `bundle install`
- `middleman`

## Requirements

More info about the work:

- The layout should be the same in every major email client.
- Minor stuff like rounded corners, hover effects, etc. is not important.
- The deliverables should still be in HAML/SCSS format. In other words, please modify the source files, not the end result.
- Please use Git to submit your changes. 
- Although the CSS is not inlined here, it will be in the final email.
